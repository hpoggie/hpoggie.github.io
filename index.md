## Underlord

![]({{site.url}}/assets/screen1.png)

Underlord is an open source online wizard battling card game, inspired by games
like Magic: the Gathering and Hearthstone. In Underlord, you get more resources
as you get closer to losing, and you must play cards face-down before you can
use them on your next turn. It has [its own
website](https://underlordcg.github.io).

## G\*\*gle Chr\*me

![]({{site.url}}/assets/screen2.png)

A top-down action game made for [Ludum Dare
42](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/ggle-chrme) where you must survive
as long as possible before your computer runs out of RAM. No, that's not a
joke; the enemies allocate a 4k texture every time they spawn. __I strongly
recommend saving your work and closing all other applications before playing.__
