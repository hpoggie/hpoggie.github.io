# About me

Hello! I'm Henry. I program video games for a living. I used to work for
[Volition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volition_(company)), the company that
made Saints Row.  Before that, I worked at Purdue University's [Envision
Center](https://www.ecshowcase.com/).  Unfortunately Volition shut down
recently, so I'm looking for full time work. I have experience with Unity, C++,
Python, and a little bit of Unreal and Godot.

Here are some things I've worked on:

# Games I've worked on

## Saints Row (2022)

Official website: [https://saintsrow.com/](https://saintsrow.com/)

On this project I worked on the Open World Gameplay team, which made most of the
non-mission gameplay, like side hustles and criminal ventures.

## Saints Row DLC

For the Saints Row 2022 DLC I worked on post-release support as well as the Kaijuice Wingsuit Challenge activity in the Heist and the Hazardous pack.

# Personal Projects

## Underlord

Underlord is an open source online wizard battling card game, inspired by games
like Magic: the Gathering and Hearthstone. In Underlord, you get more resources
as you get closer to losing, and you must play cards face-down before you can
use them on your next turn. It has [its own
website](https://underlordcg.github.io).

# Game Jams

## G\*\*gle Chr\*me

A top-down action game made for [Ludum Dare
42](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/ggle-chrme) where you must survive
as long as possible before your computer runs out of RAM. No, that's not a
joke; the enemies allocate a 4k texture every time they spawn. __I strongly
recommend saving your work and closing all other applications before playing.__

## Lost in Transmission

A game made with a team for [Global Game Jam
2018](https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/lit-lost-transmission-0) where you
have to listen to a numbers station to get the codes you need to turn on
generators while avoiding enemy robots. I did the audio as well as some of the
programming.
