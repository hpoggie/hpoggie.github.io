# Projects

## Underlord

![]({{site.url}}/assets/screen1.png)

Underlord is an open source online wizard battling card game, inspired by games
like Magic: the Gathering and Hearthstone. In Underlord, you get more resources
as you get closer to losing, and you must play cards face-down before you can
use them on your next turn. It has [its own
website](https://underlordcg.github.io).

## Faux Farmer

A farming game without your own land, made for [Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam
2018](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2018). You play as a farmer who plants his crops
on other people's property.  The goal of the game is to earn as much money as
possible from harvesting plants before the cops arrest you for vandalism.

## G\*\*gle Chr\*me

![]({{site.url}}/assets/screen2.png)

A top-down action game made for [Ludum Dare
42](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/ggle-chrme) where you must survive
as long as possible before your computer runs out of RAM. No, that's not a
joke; the enemies allocate a 4k texture every time they spawn. __I strongly
recommend saving your work and closing all other applications before playing.__
